# Metrilyzer

This is a static code analysis tool based on the Spoon library.
It can be used to read any Java project and produce data for the following metrics:

* LINES_PER_CLASS
* LINES_PER_METHOD
* PARAMETER_PER_METHOD
* COMMENTS_PER_CLASS
* CLASS_PER_PACKAGE
* METHODS_PER_CLASSES

## Sample
Here you can see a sample metric (Parameter per method) for the Spring Boot project as a Histogram.
